# Assumptions

## Soroban Event Stream Inspector (issue #78)

1. **"All 15 ScVal types" means every variant the SDK exposes.** `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
   13.3.0 defines 22 `xdr.ScValType` variants; the decoder covers all of them. A test
   asserts the count is 22 so a future SDK bump that adds a variant fails loudly instead
   of silently falling through to the typed fallback.

2. **Wide integers are returned as decimal strings, bytes as hex.** `i128`/`u128`/`i256`/
   `u256`/`u64`/`i64`/`timepoint`/`duration` cannot round-trip through JSON as BigInt, and
   `Number` loses precision past 2^53. Consumers get exact decimal strings. `raw` always
   carries the original base64 for anyone who needs the bytes.

3. **Replay signs each event as its own POST**, matching the issue's "sends each event as
   a POST" — not one batched payload. The wire format matches the rest of the repo:
   `X-SaviTools-Signature: sha256=<hex>`, HMAC-SHA256 over the exact request body, no
   timestamp prefix.

4. **Replay's HMAC secret is caller-supplied per request**, mirroring `SendWebhookDto.secret`.
   `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is documented in `.env.example` and the README but is read by
   nothing in the codebase, so it was deliberately not wired in here.

5. **Events are not persisted.** Query → decode → return; the UI holds them in component
   state. The issue describes no storage, and Soroban RPC is itself the retention layer
   (~24h).

6. **Read endpoints are public; replay is authenticated.** `CONTRACT_ADMIN_EMAILS` guards
   deploy/invoke because those spend `DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY`. Reading events spends nothing,
   and since an empty allowlist denies everyone by design, gating reads would ship the tool
   unusable. Replay sends outbound traffic, so it requires `JwtAuthGuard`.

7. **The RPC `type` filter is a parameter, not a constant.** The issue pins `type: 'contract'`
   but also asks for a `contract | system | diagnostic` badge, which is only meaningful if
   the type can vary. It defaults to `'contract'` and is overridable.

8. **Filter logic is duplicated between API and web, deliberately.** The API copy is
   authoritative and carries the test table; `apps/web/src/lib/contract-events.ts` mirrors it
   so the UI filters instantly with no round-trip. The repo already duplicates the SSRF guard
   on the same reasoning. Drift risk is the accepted cost.

9. **`ContractsModule` now imports `AuthModule`.** It used `JwtAuthGuard` on deploy/invoke
   without importing the module that provides it — `MonitorModule` is the correct pattern.
   The new `EventsController` needs it for replay, and importing it also closes that
   pre-existing gap.

10. **Decoder validation used constructed ScVal fixtures, not a deployed fixture contract.**
    The acceptance criterion asks for "a contract that emits one event of each type in a
    test transaction", which would require deploying and funding from CI. In-process
    fixtures exercise the identical decode path deterministically and offline. This was
    additionally validated against live testnet: 200 real events decoded in 451 ms with
    zero decode failures.
